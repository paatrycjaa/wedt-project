ridetrump claimed that russia will never invade the ukraine when russia already has  how stupid can people beas long as your willing to pay a lot more for products you buy then fine but you better not be going to costco and walmart to buy stuff because its cheaper if so we get to call you a hypocritical wankeronly an idiot would use and believe anything this this republican propaganda machine publishes wwwrealclearpoliticscomthanks a lot douchebag youre the reason the portland buttfuckers are getting pushed out and moving down south to the wilsonville area and beyond because of you all the stupid fucking assholes that made portland a place full of stupid fucking assholes are going to try to turn salem into some kind of newstupidfuckingassholetopia this will drive up the price of housing and displace  people down here having lived in san clemente for a time myself i think youre dumb as shit to have moved up here the fucks wrong with you outsider i hope bums shit in your yard everyday and never let you walk by without demanding spare  changekick all the non human criminal illegals out of pa and plenty of room   foolsbecause driving under ontario laws is stupid enough in ontarioyoure wrong  the delay between retirement and lobbying is nowhere near  years  this law is specifically aimed at the secdef job  the purpose of this separation is to ensure firm civilian leadership of the military  read the article  you have no idea where ive worked  dont make ignorant statementsbilly are you a complete idiot being thick headed or just not reading what people have been trying to tell you in response to your soapbox blathering  a poor people without insurance need health care too b planned parenthood provides womens health care for free to anyone  pp does these thru donations and grants from the states and fed and charity foundations  no federal money is allow to be spent on abortions  the people protesting planned parenthood know this but have decided that a zygote is a person  these same people believe that corporations are persons too  once again poor women get help with birth control via planned parenthood  poor people mostly do not have insurance and less will have insurance as soon as the gop gets done gutting aca  poor women cannot afford to go to dr for prescription birth control therefore planned parenthood is necessarytrump said in as many words that mexicans were rapists and drug dealershes a psychopathclinton should be the last person to say anything about anyone she is such a lying scum bag i cant handle just hearing her voice it would be a lot worse if she was president than we are with the crazy trump she would have her husband aka as the cigar rapist as her guide he should have been arrested for doing that to that young girl the starred eye monica how can anyone blame her but i certainly wouldnt have let him stick a cigar in me it is the medias fault because they keep going to get her big lying mouth goingpeople insist on being dumb no other explanationcanadians killed by islamic extremists the immediate result should be canada cleaning up the islamic world from one end to the other so that there are no more

becomeit didnt take much rope for the village idiot to hang himselfclinton signed that joint fundraising agreement in august  it was reported on then why is it an issue now and there wasnt anything illegal about it so its not a crime oh and the sanders campaign signed the same agreement with the dnc in oct  somehow thats overlooked though granted sanders later chose to raise money on his own not thru the fund no clinton hasnt gotten away with so many crimes because she hasnt committed them it boggles the mind that after all these revelations people would want a liar and a crook to be our president clearly refers to trump a liar and a crookmove to europe if you want to live with stupidthis guy must be from nanakuli  are all the people there so ignorant and gross  yuk million is chump

to keep those billions coming in  how long are americans going to put up with this blatant and unashamed profiteering  maybe when enough folks die because they get stung by a bee or eat shellfish and

hungary eastern europe to protect their citizens and approve of  lepen duterte is right killing druggies  but should be taken to court and sentenced to death if he had political enemies killed  unless

scare the hll out of  any voter  another advocate for a state government functioning  behind closed doors is exactly who we do not need in the alaska legislature  the  system she apparently adores the secretive standing caucus systemhas just about pounded this state into the ground  also does she understand caucus membership is all about crushing any minority view and has little to do with party platforms and everything to do with the quid pro quo of trading toady behavior for spending in deals that are done behind closed doors  stupid is as stupid doesbrilliant reply kept me in suspense

chunk of you dumbaes will be gone for goodmorons are people who take a misstatement and spin it to mean something stupid like saying trump does not know he is president of the virgin island  he knows    i remember a candidate for president once saying he had campaigned in  states  i also remember that same person as president in a memorial day speech honoring military personnel who died in service to their country commenting about how nice it was to have so many of them in the audience   moron  if you wishmuslims would beg to disagreethis ridiculous nonsense needs to stop  its abusive has cost me well over mm and has destroyed my life   by the way there is no hidden message in my comment   the situation is exactly what i am saying  and yet another idiot is sitting in the parking lot at carlaw and colgate avenue shining lights at my windows   the gangstalking and harassment endorsed by the globe and mail and the individuals and organizations who run this forum needs to stop prontoyou sucksurvival of the fittest would not have produced you you are alive because your weak blood is supported by welfare and food stamps please dont reference darwin in your icon loserre agents are some of the most manipulative narcissists around  they lie lie lie cheat cheat cheat for breakfast lunch and dinner   how do you teach someone to sell their soulthats contradicted by the facts first of all democrats have acknowledged the past and the party evolved to the antiracist side which prompted southern racists who used to constitute the solid south for the party to migrate to the gop where the south now pretty much votes solidly for republicans due to the gops adoption of the racist polices the democrats used to push if there are any remaining racists in the democratic party the members will marginalize and push them out  the democratic party of the s though was the conservative party they were not leftist at all  entitlements are not slavery thats just a silly remark prepackaged propaganda to demonize people who need help look at ben carson  on public assistance and loans and public housing all his life until he made it on his own and now he demonizes welfare bunch of hypocritesha ha ha what a friggin joke trudeau couldnt evaluate a terrorist he gave him  million trudeau you are such a useless piece of dungwhat scam are they running now watch idiots jump on wagon and toot walkers horn i guess pfd is the guarantee for this lieyou must not have read the part where i said on a lighter note  to a person who just turned on a tv it would look like something out of a crazy comedy movie   no real hockey fan would want to attend a uaa hockey game and watch that goofball stuff   you dont see aces crowds  nhl crowds  or even other college hockey teams fans acting like they all just escaped a trailer park theres a reason so few attend uaa hockey gamesand showing those fans acting loonie tunes is one of the reasons i was offering advice to help with uaas pathetic attendance problemssaying dont show stuff like that on tv if you want real hockey fans to attend i couldnt care in the least if you consider my comments credible or not the bottom line is   if uaa wants to draw more fans to gamestheyll stop showing crowd shots of craziness   fans want to watch the gamenot see tons of kids bouncing off the wallstheres a difference between saying the choice is a mistake and inferring a user is stupid nothing personal friendclinton lost because shes an unlikable incompetent hack who has  a long history of corruption bribetaking lawbreaking graft greed and who purposely handled classified documents on an illegal and vulnerable private server in her bathroom  she didnt lose because of the russians she lost because of  years of lying cheating corrupt behavior and arrogant stupiditywhy is this black racist crap still on the gm website  i stopped talking to black people long ago because i was afraid for my life since  of all crime is by black people it kinda makes sense doesnt it oh wait thats profiling or is it driving while black  i dont know you leftist marxists and  blm nutjobs change the names so fast no one can keep up so what do we do when the facts speak like this wash it all away by letting identity marxists spew their racist hatred of white people i think not so because you commit most of the crimes in the world why the why the f would we give you the time of day clean up your sht first  you people are the problem own itbecause donald trump is a hateful windbag with old family money obama earned his way into the presidency within the lawi love how fellow troglodytes vote in agreement with you despite your falsehoods   let me see our middle class taxes were lowered and this also benefits the wealthy but yes they did rise for those making over k  boo hoo  our corporate taxes are already in the  range and have been for a long time   so where are these tax increased under wynne or trudeau name them     you believe trump can get rid of half just a guess of federal revenue and it will benefit society  you think that is how it works  do tell   how does the fact that within the next  years we will all lose another  of jobs due to technology  tell me how that factors in for you  what about the fact that globally we are adding about  million more people a year but require less labour  how does that factor in let me tell you  should we always just let the  reap the benefits of technology none of them have invented   simple minded answers are for the far right among usits a madeup word to hide islams paranoid hatred of nonbelievers it really is kuffirphobia fear of infidels that is driven into the very heart of muslims we must not allow any religious nutjobs islam or otherwise to impose their crazy nonsense on others via pain of the lawreality is a bitch isnt ittrumps traitors™ need to be purged from any and all government positions now the gop congress needs to find their spines and stop defending these criminalstrump trollthey are being persecuted good fuck those fucking cuntstrump is definitely a worthless stain on america hes definitely a sick fascist white supremacist traitorits really bizarre the way the leftists always seem to show up with paraphernalia condemning people who dont share their dogma for being racists bigots idiots morons intolerant closeminded cruel murderers  or the catchall haters  is that an pound oxymoron i see sitting over there in the cornerim surprised to find such a tonedeaf article in the denver post trashahhh the same comey you thought was soooooooo great a while back that comey right total hypocrite liar you are fact who pays you to post lies anywayignorant selfish racist misogynistic snowflakes were the major part of trump gaining enough electoral votes  you cant fix stupidjustin trudeau is too busy with his pay for access chinese friends and getting advice from and giving taxpayers money to the billionaire islamic spiritual leader the aga khan than worry about the fact that canadians cant afford to live in their own cities anymore   silly canadiansall you said is true however we as viewers arent the ones responsible for programming im not sure how shows like  the shows youve listed or amish mafia mermaids and the like fared in focus groups or who previewed these shows before airing but clearly the cable network thinks were all a bunch of idiotsbecause thats your name which i know since you told me long ago take your crazy pill donright on the only reason he came out with these ludicrous statements and attempted to deflect the hacking argument away from the russians was  his  ego he was scared shless that his election would be overturned and we know that trump never loses what a loserbarefoot pregnant and ignorant  the three  rs per dunleavyit was ignorant  you dont know me  you dont know what i do or how often i buy cars  i could be a fleet buyer  you dont knowthats ignorance  and it was snark  you made a snide remark that was derogatory or mocking about how often i purchase cars  a snide remark is snark  anything else youd like to be taught todaythievestrump is too stupid to understand that in provoking china he is not dealing with a defenseless country like iraq or libya besides its significant economic power china is also a nuclear power and can put together an army ten times the size that americans can if necessary talking big is one thing backing it up is another thing entirely hopefully the generals and diplomats will be able to straighten trump out before he does any serious damageyes he is as stupid as he is portrayed  i dont hope i just wish he wasnt a lying and in his own words a  grabber  but to each his ownhamas and fatah teach their kids that there is no twostate solution they perpetuate suffering and violence and reward inhuman cowards for stabbing pregnant women in grocery stores to describe bin ladens cowardly attack on the us as brilliant only further reveals an opinion void of credibility integrity or rational thought  bin laden was a rabid animal and he was put down accordingly islamist terrorists are cowards by nature a quality evidently shared by their sympathizerswhat describes you  idiot dufus stupid dumpy etc  not name calling just describing your behavior and thinkingur patheticwhat walker has done took balls and im not a state employee nor an adn columnist so basically your statement is full of shitebullet between the eyesi wanted to know your reaction if he did that to your kid stupid dooon  saad fuck you son bitchoreilly like trump and roger ailes is an oversexed lunatic  they all apparently believe they can do anything they want because they possess power over others  pathetic  wonder why trump felt he is a good candidate to defend oreilly  oh yeah he is a narcissistic child who never learned appropriatenessapparently this nation isnt ready for a woman as president yet even a highly qualified and intelligent woman with a lot of international diplomatic experience but its equally apparent this nation will accept an ignorant man with no governing diplomatic or military experience who fobs his business debts of on banks partners and contractors lies nonstop tweets inanely at the wee hours and has less attention span than a fruit fly  a college education as you know doesnt even guarantee literacy most of those voters probably had business degrees which means social and economic conservative mixed with social pretenses bigotry toward working people and a distrust or disrespect toward women this election was an eyeopener for mehes disgustingam i just taking your troll bait or do you have evidence to support your claim that the reporter is vileif you were being pimped out by your husband and beaten while he was sitting on his ass probably playing video games than who and what would you feel sorry for its time to not give these losers a break okgo away  bigoted jerkwhat a loser  someone has to start teaching these stupid kids that ascension to the lofty ranks of college football player does not absolve them of the responsibility to act like human beingsyour defence of the indefencible is sad pathetic and weakpot calling the kettle black hypocritethis news source has been on trumps side most of the way  ha ha ha ha where do these bozos come from  sooo many idiots sooo little timeyoure an idiot  go to the court house and read mr weavers and his attorneys admissions they admit that everything that ive said is true  but i have heard that the rg koolaid is deliciousyou dont inherit hypocrisy farce  back to high school for youtrying to determine what the trump administration will do is impossible a discussion with trump is more like organizing an intervention with a psychotic we stand our ground and let the chips fall well be just fine as the saying goes never argue with an idiot they will only bring you down to their level and beat you with experiencei know its exactly the same with the morons who conflate footballers and footballrepublicans are the cause of the degraded condition of our roads not bicycles  we need to tax the clueless irresponsible idiotsif you werent an ignorant vicious troll you would be aware that kim is threatening to murder hundreds of millions of innocent people  moronic trolls like yourself  but you are what you are trollwhat he did was very stupid but visitor bans are worthless theres alot of people that go through there every day it would be impossible to stop him if he were to go back i wouldnt be surprised if he put on a fake mustache or otherwise changed his appearance and went back next weekend if he doesnt do any other stupid things hed probably get away with itdoufus is putting it mildly the chinese are thieves actuallythis is either dumb or stupid  the issue most folks have is not with the size of the pfd but the fact that we are giving up any of our pfd while we throw money at wealthy oil companies in the form of tax deductions  if the senate will pass the wilsonseaton oil tax bill am sure the house will get behind the senate pfd bill it is called compromisethere is no bill the  figure is a guideline numerous other countries are below canada in their contributions and canada spends a great deal of money on defense related activities that dont qualify for nato but do contribute to nato coast guard for example   in other words youre whining is misplaced youve admitted you are an american and no doubt a trump supporter good luck with acquiring support in canada for that hapless buffoonso what if donald is a liar he has other good qualities like being a puy grabbin racist  lol  obstruction collusion  stupidity  the clown is going downyou are a delusional lib troll of stupid canada  is not doing squat in the world other than paying for access with justin here we laugh at his bs and lack of any sense of what an economy is thats not hate loser thats realitytrump is an idiot  also the generals are showing their vast limitations  asserting military options threatening to destroy a country unless it obeys you  thats all big gun international relations with a finesse deficiency that has the us on the brink of catastrophic war  the us didnt have to move to that sort of trump doctrine and now that it has the question for the rest of the world is whos the next target  who will next become threatened with destruction of their country if they dont do what trump wantsmaybe the dotard should learn to keep his big mouth shutevery day will have stuff like this detritus of the cyclone of stupidity that is donald trumpyou cant fix stupid but you can fight itfuck you wavemakeryou hit the nail on the head  republicans should be denouncing idiot trump en masse  instead they are defending him at worst or looking the other way and hummingi fly all the time around the world  no you do not youre not an independently wealthy jet setter and youre not a pilot youre a retired garbage manwhat a circle jerk for all to see in living color  politically motivated and tax payer funded garbage  as if we do not have serious crimes to actually look at with lynch and comey as well

just sayinthis is what happens when people start to become so dependent on government that they wont even discipline their own kids this is very similar to the s and s fear of excessive television

power to not uphold their oaths of office and their salaries should not be paidand with it goes billion in taxpayer subsidies  canadians are such suckersthere it is in a nutshell   fear loathing and hatred of  liberals is what drives these people   they would vote for a slate of kangaroos provided that the kangaroos were portrayed as the opposition to the liberal agenda  pathetic and mindlessif youre stupid enough to have a back yard in bear territory yesoh trust me the first pockets he will be picking are yours lol your a fool if you dont get that im pro not letting any of those bastards in

officers what a stupid press releasehomosexual men define their own masculinity    its bs statements like that that invite ridicule  if you insist on entering the fray in that manner dont complain when the truth kicks you right in the hiney  simply put it is the antithesis of masculinity for a man to  ill remain polite  have another man sexuallyand was the oklahoma bombing which was our worst albeit i neglected to mention it as killing  people including little children also wasnt the work of muslim terrorists but of our own homespun craziesblackmailed is the title of his new book  although he probably would get blackmailed more for the things hes done past and present hehe  besides why do you think most of the republicans are still at his side they cant be that stupidthe government has already sold about  per cent of the shares in hydro one and plans to sell another  per cent to raise billions of dollars to pay down debt and to fund public transit and infrastructure projects  sure thats what we want wynne and her incompetent band of crooks getting access to more money theyve already driven the ontario economy over a cliff of course theyll spend it on paying down the debt which is everestsized and costs  billion dollars each month to service  thanks kathy and funding infrastructure and transit bullfeathers that cash will disappear into the same black hole as all the resttheyll burn through that money faster than a winddriven grass fire then theyll come looking for more its what they do and its what theyve done a whole lot of their pals will get rich in the process and the rest of us will be left holding an empty bag how anyone could believe one word that these lying bunch of thieves says is astoundingwhat these two judges did is mindboggling  they said that foreigners living in foreign countries have a constitutional right to come to the us  yes that is the effect of their ruling  it is unprecedented and unconstitutional  they should resign or be impeached for stupidityim all for peaceful protests but just complaining about the way things are without trying to convey how things should be doesnt get you very far in my books and being violent and belligerent is always stupid you do nothing to bring people together that way  which is what i think the majority of successful protests are about  if youre someone who does see trump as your president and think this is how everyone who disagrees with me is like then youre just as foolishthis man is a bonified traitor they should make an example of him to disuade others from taking such actions they used to shoot traitors now they just put them in military prisons for a while and then give them sex change surgery upon request and we pay for it the only thing we should be giving them is a last meal of their choice and the option of a blind fold a cigarette or any last words their actions are an affront to all who have served their country honorablyshe was postbeat beat  literary yet fuck it all  like neil cassady kerouacdamn brilliant writer regardlessas fingers mcdoofus an old c friend of mine name changed to protect the stupid told me pay attention when dealing with explosivesa clueless fool and demagogue like trump cannot bring it back shocker    just like his foolish approach to things like trade and automation are likely to fail too    unfortunately far too few of politicians  especially on the right where latestage capitalism is an article of faith  are looking at things systemically or even taking advice of experts that do    the conspiracy theories and scapegoating that is likely to occur under stupid leadership like trump as we go through the coming changes are potentially quite dangerousreally weve endured at least  straight days of globe articles against trump and im sure your garbage replies are on at least  of those not sure who you are trying to kid miller once again your stupidity astounds mestupidshe isnt charged so shit isnt working obviously i know she isnt because she is my mom and i ate lunch with her todaylol they all steal we supported eu too you think democrats dont enjoy it now explain why both sides disliked trump probably because he heartened to bring down there game thanks for pointing out that trump wasnt a thing during brexit once again couldnt figure out the point people dislike the guise of refugees immigrants and the lovey dovey bs that goes along with it i dont need a lesson on that and it was not even my point once again trump and farage and the next eu leaders are very relative to the point of immigration my second point was the fact that all countries steal from there citizens and launder we citizens get screwed from every country you can say the we launder to the usa but its politicians republican and democrat the usa launders to me canada etc and the liberals and conservatives here are happy they all seem to dislike trump which should be a big clue to his relativity in not only immigration but all policies once again i can clearly see the idiotnah hes a clueless buffoonhow is it clueless humans are encroaching on every wild place we put trails through the wilderness and by salmon streams and then idiots decide that that would be a great place to run or bike through where would you like them to go all animals will report to the top of the peaks and not come down until were done playing where you eat and sleep seriously instead of making an idiotic remark to make someone mad why not tell us all where the wild animals should go we have surrounded them and cut through their homes we are supposed to be the smartest animals on the planet but still we do these things wake up or move back to the lower  freeheelsof course there is no substance to this event it shouldnt matter but as the election nears the ndp and perhaps the greens need every opportunity to discredit the premier and the liberals why because their platforms are both very weak and are dependent on higher taxes the economy is booming in bc and unemployment is low what better way to derail that by voting in a tax and spend new government as was once said so eloquently its the economy stupidwow how times have changed all hail the muslim it wasnt so very long ago that christians were told to remove all crosses from government properties in hawaii and even some privately owned churches were heartily challenged now we have foreign born muslims on the front page and their right to be is heavily protected go figureso if the state oil subsidy structure is so flawed why the heck are we electing oil guys to the legislature stupid is as stupid doesonly the mad king would invite and encourage lawsuits that are paid for with taxpayers dollars  who the hll voted for this bloated jackassgo fck yourself moron every american deserves the right to free speech and to protest in a way they see fityour a nut job liberal troll of bs save it loser we laugh at the complete nonsense blaming harris bs god you liberals never change always consistently ignorant lying and full of itsalazar said there was no “bad intent” on the part of distefano george or macintyre but rather “mistakes” were made  huh i learned a long time ago in the principle of cya when something like this happened in my area of responsibility i was reaching out to legal and hr to make sure things were handled by the book    no looking away  no bad intent dont give me that    at best it was gross stupidity coupled with a severe case of willful blindnessthis is disgraceful for the dems  to use this family as a prop and to bait trump who fell for it is a new low their son was killed by muslim extremists not trump he was an american soldier trumps response was stupid and clumsy there are no winners herejon stewart used to avoid referring to bolling by name instead describing him as the dumb one among foxs talking heads now we know whyand i assume the middle class includes the high income earning support industries for the oil companies the racketeerhealth care complex in alaska the out of state carpetbagging oil industry workers and ceos and shareholders around the world profiting from our natural resources   get the idea out of your head that people are paid what theyre worth  the koch brothers who inherited their wealth make  times per hour more than what a nurses aide does lazy ass nurses aide  because you live in the bush there may be no jobs lazy asses   tough that your culture has been coopted all because you wanted to have a nice school in your community so your kids could be part of the dominant culture should have raised them stoneage style instead  im sure all the middleclass selfrighteous types here invented western culture and material wealth independently and by the aid of only their ingenious bootstraps why should they share with those lazy villagerstell that to the islamists who pray five times a day  tell that to the sex fiends who are teaching grade  students homosexuality and gender identity  what kind of men and boys will these students be to women when they have no self controlquit being a plethora of idiotic statementsthese oil soaked clowns in the legislative majorities have drug this out for  months now and this is the best they can come up with if i were walker id plant their asses in anchorage where the public can get to them for as long as it takes and for as many special sessions as it takes theyve already cost us millions and millions of dollars on garbage that well never see a dimes worth of return on hold their feet to fire until they accomplish the one thing they are paid to do that is to come up with a viable and sustainable budget for the peoplethe truth hurts so you have to resort to idiotic comments you just dont understand how ignorant you arenobody is falling for trumps bait and switch anymore his comments are pathetic and ignorant for a potus his inability to grasp the importance of such an office is a stain on all americans who voted for him his constant lying is a burden on the democratic process his own party has given up and go in hiding every morning worried about what he has tweeted again at  am there needs to be consequences applied to this type of behaviour impeach no  for placing the national security of the usa in jeopardyi always knew they were a bunch of morons on the left coast now this just proves my pointi remember when lying in politics was much more imaginative now they just say anything stupidstupid argument although i hesitate to even call it an argument  try

with you proposal as being ludicrous  okaythe president is obviously mentally ill  this is not how a  year old man acts  ever  even his worshipers are finally  at long last  beginning to understand the depths of his multiple personality defects and his cartoonlike incompetence  trump must be removed from officedear brad sherman liberal idiot   i have printed out your articles of impeachment  which i am now using to wipe my diarrhetic arse  thats what i think  of you and your articleswhoever wrote this article is a mainstream media jerkgriffins behavior was disgusting and i beg my fellow liberals never  again to sink to this low level of behavior as we struggle to prevent the further degradation of society by the ignorant and hateful  we need to keep to the high road to have a chance of winning but we sometimes fail in fact i remember there was a particularly sickening young guy who used to skate around eugene with a mask of president bushs head on a platter such jerks are not our allieswhat an ignorant statementi dont believe you can justify your two statements the first is plainly untrue even idiotic the second is also untrue to the point of idiocyand he is so surprisingly stupid  trump is both ignorant and unintelligent  but he continues to think and act as though he is the smartest guy in the roomdid none of you fools that strategically voted trudeau a majority government not foresee this kind of incompetence happening  unbelievablethere are lunatics like dylann roof on every cornerwhat harm  have you ever heard of someone getting attacked by a bear while taking a dump in the woods  please  does just owning a gun make someone paranoid and a puy at the same timeblack males are disproportionately shot by police go on what else is disproportionate about black male behavior youre so close but just wont put your finger on it will you washington post honestly committing  of violent crime and only being  of those shot by police sounds like it would be evidence of police bias in their favorhang this guy and his pilau wifesluts come in both male and female    when two sluts fornicate without simple cheap readily available contraception supposedly from planned parenthood unwanted children are often the result  dilatation and curettage  stir  repeat    stir repeatthe idiot violated bedrock firearm safety including likely alcohol andor drug use he should do time   no one who is using booze or drugs should go near a firearmyou sir an idiotthere is another thing about the american tourist other than mostly great guests of the state  somehow they forgot to pack their common sense and most of their brains at home in their own state  keeping you and your children safe in paradise only takes a few minutes of your time reinforcing the rules of safety when visiting a strange place   even locals drown fall off mountainsides and yes they even get lost when they deviate off the trails in the dense mountainous vegetation  why does the tourist feel the host people can keep tourists safe in every situation where a naive decision was made to do something you have never chanced to do in your own world at home  if you indulge in drinking heavily off shore until youre whacked out of your mind  say no more   it is plain stupid choices and made at your own riskwow youre that guy then the ones that think killing women and children is fine as long as they arent your women and children youre sickthis dude is a bad assmaybe its time to deport ezra  after all his lies propaganda and racism he has no place in this great country  such a sad loseragreed you cant reach the lost by being a judgmental jerk who makes kids cry christ calls real christians to be compassionate and come along side people in there darkest days not yell at them to repent as they come out of the bar theres a time to talk about the consequences of sin but if you dont be compassionate first nobody will care about what you have to say plus a position of judgment is the worst place to preach from about sin paul constantly used his past to lovingly show that he understood where they were right then and he accepted them when you can say look ive been where you are and have felt what you feel you will have much more of an impact when people act like this it makes the world think this is christianity just my  centsnow could the good doctor anal yse justin for his

indecentignorant people they keep digging themselves in further with their belief in their moral superiority although it simply offers more offence to those who they demean the fact is that liberalleftprogressive dogma has lost a great deal of credibility with a significant number of americans and canadians and selfrighteously indignant rants by the diehards simply confirm the validity of the choice madeyour posts shows you are stupid periodignorant uneducated foolidiots you have a job resign and go sell apples at the stationget outta here claw  you got that stupid story from a

not looking for likes from the douches on the left right political side of things you can’t honestly think this though our government federally and provincially across canada works exactly like this the more money in the more money spent it is always and will always be spent with little oversight common sense little efficiency that’s it you see provinces with hst taxing more that have massive debts obviously more money didn’t make them better money managers quite the opposite actually they post phony  surpluses but debts are ever increasing the problem is the way money is spent that’s it bloated public sectors that’s sole obligation is to become more bloated what bloats more then more money don’t be naive to think less equalization would magically turn these inept politicians to manage money any better that includes cons libs and dippers they have zero sense of money management and probably never willthats it boast about your stupidityso many anal people on this sitecan you

delusional infinite wisdom acts as if stupidity is a virtue if we want to prevent him turning this country into trumpistan get him out of office and make america great againright after trump blamed

attempting to respond to one of this forums most active and pernicious trolls haters are gonna hate no matter what evidence or argument you presentwhen our pathetic racist president obama said police acted stupidly in the dc case he declared open season on police across america he is to blame for the racial divide in america today  and in other news  blacks continued to slaughter other blacks last weekend in chicago where is the protest over that   black lives clearly dont matter if blacks are the ones doing the killingus american  laugh laughlaugh marvel at the sheer ignorance  it was called tarsands in the original process patents the term oil sands is nothing more than lipstick on a pigthanks mazie you foolthat might not be the stupidest comment i have read on these threads but it is running a damn close secondback pedaling coward clearly murkowski would kill himcome on motley thats garbage i expect better from you so my question stands did romney get on his knees under the dinner table to presumably perform fellatio on donald trump really why bring that filth to this forum whether true or not and we all know it isnt true its just something vile that crept out of your brain  sorry some days i can handle bs other days it just seems like trash from hellthe way some of you throw around calling people racist nazi sympathizer a is pathetic you have no argument so you deflect and try to falsely label people   again im from a multiracial family with black white mexican jewish et al members and unlike you i have actually had someone in my family murdered by the kkk   according to your logic i am racist and antisemitic against myself and family do you see how ignorant your comment is now probably not because you dont deal in reality only wishful thinking and willful ignorance of said realitybecause people tend to be emotiondriven idiots which is why politicians and activists are always aiming at your heartstringsyou lie and in a sniveling tone i bring up hillary because mr hahn would have her and her islamic friends run the us sad and patheticyeah all you knuckleheads go ahead  make myyyyy day it will be hyyyuuuge just like all of my hyyyuuuge casino bankruptcies getting all others to take the fault and financial fall for me by losing money this trump  will have the united states filing for bankruptcy within  days of taking office when i refuse to let the treasury secretary pay the interest on the amount of debt we are beholden to them chinese for one strange ellebrity concocked power trip   but hey well just give alaska andor hawaii to them as their us collateral owed and get them off our backs  and yet im still amazed at how many of my supporters have given me the pass on my taxes i love the poorly educatedyou wouldnt know truth if it came up and smack you on the  buttthe only morons i see hear are those who rated your comment as civilin realty jeff stober  is  very cruel self serving and nasty to say the least he just acts like hes a good person because it benefits his companys profit margin if someone wrote the actual truth about him everyone would be appalledso much winning by nikki haley  shes going to make a great first woman president sorry hillary but no one likes you but everyone likes nikki haley plus shes way better looking and not a lesbian owhat an idiot  i am a christian and i believe in jesus but there is no harm in this anyway  its just a fun thing to do on christmas  i knew who jesus was since i was very young and i knew there was no santa or reindeer that flew  its just harmless  he was way out of linei hope they find this jerk and get the signs back    never knew they made trails like this  way cool  i hope they make more so those who cant enjoy our other trails now will some dayallie in  only  million came from general funds   million came from the so called ceded land revenues and  million from their endowment whose original corpus was revenues due from so called ceded lands  you are either ignorant or lying either way paa ka wahaedwin you are a joke  first you make claims about longevity that have long ago been debunked because yiu couldnt be bothered to read the whole story  you change your tune and say you cant judge reliabilty by high milegae you keep changing the factors to try and perpetuate your lies before you were comparing high mileage to longevity and now you want to change that   totally unbelievable like most of the garbage and unsupported comments you spew forthmost of them are too stupid to understand what is going onthe science makes manitobas action stupidcome on globe  mail  the headline is ridiculous at least correct it and say the trudeausi will never watch again     roger goodell  you are an asstypical hate bases left wing stupidity this was one great persontdm as usual cant debate against facts proving his stupidity over and overtoo bad they didnt catch him after he killed himself would be cheaper for the state sorry ass possenator bennett is busy blaming trump who had nothing to do with obama care im surprised there are actually that many stupid people that believe himrather than give the money back to weinstein give it away this guy must have been a jerk even when he was young  to claim that he was raised in a time when this behavior was ok is blatant excusemaking and disrespectful how ignorant does he believe people really areif laughing at useless rich kids is wrong i dont want to be rightmuslims can kiss my white christian ass deleting this is an infringement on my freedom of speechid happily take nixon and both bushies at the same time than this professional con man and his spawnbut the christ as supernatural entity believers also tend to believe in reincarnation and astrology   pick one and stick to it please  once you are ignorant enough to believe one brand of superstition it seems that you have little trouble believe contradictory brands the human mind is amazing in what it can rationalise against all evidencethe most pathetic president in history is getting desperate  trumps motto should have been make america desperate and pathetic againdonald will bury it by saying something stupid in order to get all the media attention back on him  he lacks impulse control and simply cant help himself narcissists are like thatya they areno they as antiamerican as it gets they are nazis instead of secede they should be rounded up and kicked out of the united states they are the enemies of democracy and human rights garbagethere are localized outbreaks of gun violence in epidemic proportions  criminal gangs of specific ethnicities  black hispanic and asian respectively  that is not a racist comment either  just a recitation of the facts of lifeand deathwhat ahole came up with this    gotta be a damn democrate whoever thinks he should be released after being a trader to his country and fellow troops should be shot with him and their bodies burnedwell dave maybe if my ancestors killed off most of yoursthen we would be providing health care for youwho is the stupid head who built a rock wall to enclose the boat dock across the street from the oahu club that was supposed to be left open so floods can drain naturally now this will cause delayed drainage and more flooding to wider areas destroy it nowor perhaps it would be more expedient for the commission to throw such letters in the trash themselves and save the bishops staffs the trouble  i think this was the original plan but francis could not get mullers permission for this because it violated the principle of stupidiaritywillfully blind and ignorantgod youre an idiot people who drink water are more likely to drink alcohol when they get older people who walk are more likely to drive cars your logic is as flawed as tanning beds and bicycles yes you make no sensebut a stupid hs mascot somehow is relevant to the unhinged left  your hypocrisy is showing again and againidiot security guard firing his

morningridiculous logic  gm sure seem hooked to real estate industry cash propaganda pieces in exchange of ad cash trudeau and paying interest on massive federal debtuh no millennial are lazy dodgy when it comes to workwork schoolwork they do alright and dumb they are brainwashed by  years of govt school eg leftist four or more years of leftist college with a soft degree on top of that no we really would not be better off if them kind of folk started voting in drovesare you illiterate chuckwhy would you want to legislate stupiditythe denver donkeys are back  the special teams coach mccoy and the head coach should lose their jobs  you put a guard in a tackle and cant figure out how to give the guy some help  we never seem to do this  defense was good but still cant cover backs or tes  special teams was less than special  offense with the great pretender at qb is terrible  he must be the best practice player in the world but the worst when it comes to game time  mcnown was pretty bad too  run the freaking ball  sd had the worst d against the run  denver is just being stupidshe opened the front door and fired a round because she was angry it cost a family a loved one i dont know  years seems too short in some ways how are people this incredibly stupidthe comments of a pure troll  rebuild since i guess that means your sens have been rebuilding sincewhen  or whatever it wasonly the morons who voted for himgo away lying troll you dont know dearborn from dog shiteastman claimed that at west point he was subjected to speeches by gay cannibalsbecause trudeau knows that his federal liberal party survives on voters with brain damage from recreational pot usecan she just kill herself alreadyi will fight the white nationalists along side you again the assumptionsone can only hope they are this stupid  lol but  the democrats reaction and conduct to trump being elected clearly demonstrates they are just plain hippocrates and encourage violence to support their agendahot wire electric will be paying serious damages for their stupidityand yet you dont condemn the outright racism bigotry and thuggery of blm and antifa that makes you exactly the same as any other racist bigot and thug must suck to be youonly socialists see such success as such abject failure  others are celebrating but we never never never hear about them other than how evil and stupid they aretrump’s tax returns what did we learn    that rachel maddow is an idiot  this entire episode has blown up in her face  she deserves itand do you define solid proof outside of mathematics and physics correct me if there are others you can never have definitive proof of anything  you can have evidence and in this case there seems to be many converging threads of evidence the question is why is all this evidence appearing in the political discourse now some people think that its because obamas a sore loser or the intelligence communities want to embarass trump or they are simply inept   my theory is simpler there is evidence because the attempt to influence the election was real and the dividends the russians will accrue as a result are considerable they arent stupididiot should resignive never before seen so much ignorance in a single post you have absolutely no clue what youre taking about the sheer level of stupidity you managed to cram into just a few sentences is amazing how can someone be so utterly wrong on so many levelsthank you secretary mnuchin do not let the hypocrites winyoure a fake alrightgrand standing egomaniacs   oh i get it unlike trump and clinton right   the dems and the reps are two sides of the same corrupt coin if you want the same old crap feel free to vote for the same old crapare you a woman no then why are you commenting and making light of a womans issue cant even shut your mouth and posts more than once why was your puy grabbed were you talked about as chattel were you insulted over and over again no then why are you even on this thread you are so freaking ignorant that you epitomize trumps followers keep your trap shut about issues that dont concern your male genitaliathen keep your vagina off the internetsuck my dread thatwhat a stupid question  how about the taxpayers right to enjoy our facilities  the state and city are more concerned with the non taxpaying vendors how much you want to bet that they dont pay any taxesthis governors a moron alaska is its own worst enemy on this was just a statement of fact not an insult maybe walker should listen to the customer and find out what they wantbut  trumps not bluffing hes prepared to go scorched earth as president he has that economic  power  and yes he is that stupid    so now whats your plan bcant believe the limited knowledge of this article and the comments   unbelievable not even going to attempt to argue with stupidi think it conservative idiots who cannot react in proportionyoure an idotgo awayunless there is wording in the employment contract saying otherwise then they or you or i or anybody can indeed be fired for being stupid or arrogant or for driving the wrong color car or because our boss is having a really bad day in oregon you can be fired
