same year, reproduced below http://www.chezbasilio.it/immagini/corradi_drw.gif.', 'this drawing formed the basis for meuccis caveat of 1871, but, as meuccis lawyer did not file it with the caveat, it was later notarized by meucci himself in his affidavit of 9 october 1885.the drawing shows a two-way, simultaneous, telephone conversation, with a complete separation between the two directions of transmission (indicated by arrows).', 'this contrivance is aimed to counteract the so-called side-tone effect, that is, the hearing of the echo of the speakers own voice (as well as any background noise) in his own receiver.', 'this layout is known today as a four-wire circuit.', 'with it, meucci anticipated any other inventor, as proved by the following:  no mention of side-tone effects, nor measures to counteract it, are found in bells patents, nor in grays caveat, both of 1876. in the first bells subscriber lines, the four (initially, two) instruments were simply put in series on the same line.', 'the first anti-sidetone (ast) circuits were introduced by the bell people in the 1900s, particularly by george a. campbell, with his nine patents of 1918, many decades after meuccis solution was shown in this drawing, and over thirty years after the same drawing was notarized.', '2) inductive loading  the drawing reproduced above http://www.chezbasilio.it/immagini/lemmi_drw.gif is taken from a note jotted down by meucci in his laboratory notebook on 27 september 1870, and reported in an affidavit by m. lemmi of 28 september 1885, containing the english translation of said

horseshoe or bar iron core).', 'in diagram no.', '4, the inductor is split into two parts, inserted at both ends of the line.', 'in his notes, meucci pointed out that, in this way, he could get rid of the battery, and that, by splitting the inductor, he obtained better results.', 'this technique is known today as the inductive loading of long distance telephone lines, allowing to increase the distance and/or the quality of speech.', 'the proof that meucci came first, can be drawn from the following events, occurred many years after meuccis discovery (or its notarization):  in june-july, 1887, oliver heaviside and alfred vaschy predicted, on the basis of mathematical calculations, that telephone signals could be transmitted without distortion by increasing the lines self-induction.', 'on 19 june 1900, m. i. pupin obtained the first two patents for said technique.', 'the bell telephone co. acquired both patents and, later on, applied them in its lines  3)means to counteract the skin effect  because of the increased bandwidth of the telephone with respect to the telegraph, telephone lines were subjected to increased attenuation, due to the so-called skin effect.', 'in two notes of 1862 in his laboratory notebook (notarized in lemmis affidavit of 1885), meucci suggested to treat the surface of the (copper) conductor in various ways (basically with graphite) to increase its surface conductivity.', 'moreover, in his caveat of 1871, meucci stated: “i believe it preferable to have the wire of larger area than that ordinarily employed in the electric telegraph.” another note in his notebook, dated 17 august 1870, reads: “to be adopted, for having long distance, bundles of copper wire insulated with cotton or any other kind of wrapper; by this means i have obtained a distance of about one mile.” for this bundle of copper wires meucci filed a us patent application wire for electrical purposes on 2 july 1880.  that meucci was first in said techniques, is proven by the following facts:  skin effect in telephone lines was neglected by all inventors till 1880, when it began to be investigated by david e. hughes and oliver heaviside.', 'following their studies and the development of hard drawn copper, the bell telephone co. decided to use copper in place of steel, beginning from the boston-new york line, which was inaugurated on 27 march 1884.', '4) call signaling  meucci adopted a telegraphic call signaling, simply effected by a morse key, attached to each end of the line, momentarily short-circuiting the local transmitter.', 'in this way, strong
